# Git Workflow Guidelines

## § 1.1 Commit Message Prefixes

Include scope in parentheses:
- `fix(auth)`: bug fixes
- `feat(parsing)`: new features
- `perf(flashcard)`: performance improvements
- `docs(readme)`: documentation changes
- `style(modal)`: formatting changes
- `refactor(schemas)`: code refactoring
- `chore(deps)`: maintenance tasks

## § 1.2 Commit Rules

- Use lowercase for commit messages
- Keep the summary line concise
- Include description for non-obvious changes
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

**Example**: `refactor(schemas): extract validation utilities`

## § 2.0 Code Review Process

- Read PR description and linked issues
- Run build/lint/tests locally if applicable
- Skim changes for scope creep and unrelated edits
- Check accessibility on interactive changes
- Verify keyboard navigation for interactive UI
- Prefer concrete suggestions and links to guidelines when requesting changes
