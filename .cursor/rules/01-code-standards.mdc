# Code Review Standards

## § 4.1 Core Principles

- **Readability**: Clear, concise code with meaningful names
- **SRP/DRY/Modularity**: Single responsibility, avoid duplication, clear component boundaries
- **Idiomatic Usage**: Follow official patterns for Svelte 5/SvelteKit
- **Technical Debt**: Remove bloat and redundancies as you touch code
- **Error Handling**: Consistent, actionable errors; no swallowed exceptions
- **Security & Performance**: No new vulnerabilities; no unexpected regressions

## § 4.2 Review Checklist

### Functional Correctness
- No regressions; existing behaviors preserved
- Edge cases identified and handled

### Maintainability and Design
- Code is easy to read and navigate
- Adheres to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Eliminates duplication (DRY)
- Eliminates any unused variables
- Decoupled, modular components with clear boundaries
- Uses idiomatic project/library patterns
- Consistent, appropriate error handling

### Architecture Alignment
- Domain-driven multi-store architecture is respected
- Smart Store pattern followed for feature-domain stores
- Svelte 5 Runes patterns and accessibility requirements followed
- Optimistic UI patterns used for mutations where appropriate

## § 4.3 Svelte 5 Patterns

Use runes syntax for component props and state:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  let { stroke = 'currentColor', size = 24 } = $props();
  let count = $state(0);
</script>
```

### Component Communication
- Props down, events up
- Use stores for shared state across components
- Derived stores for computed values
