- What: Minimal language learning app for sentence parsing and flashcard review—no feature bloat, no membership required.
- Current state: Two primary modes—Parsing Mode (text tokenization, morpheme notes) and Flashcard Mode (deck-based review, filtering).
- Principles (agent-facing): simplicity first; user owns their data (`ownerUid` on all docs); validate with Zod schemas; follow design system colors and icon conventions.
- App shape: SPA with toolbar-driven mode switching. Parsing Mode handles text input → tokenization → notes → flashcard creation. Flashcard Mode handles review, filtering, and deck organization.
- Inputs: User-typed or pasted sentences in target language; notes (vocab/grammar) attached to morphemes; flashcards generated from notes.
- Flow: Text Entry → Tokenize → Parse (break/combine nodes) → Add Notes → Create Flashcards → Study (spaced repetition).
- Invariants: all data filtered by `ownerUid`; Firestore security rules enforce user isolation; seamless mode transitions; consistent UI via design tokens in `app.css`.
