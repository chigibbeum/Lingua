description: Client UI conventions — Svelte 5, accessibility, icons, forms, design
globs:
  - src/**/*.svelte
intent: Consistent, accessible UI aligned with design system
---

- Svelte 5 only — use runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`), Snippets for child content; no legacy syntax.
- Accessibility: guarantee keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and focus management for all interactive elements.
- Icons: use icon components from `src/lib/icons/`; always include `aria-label` prop for buttons.
- Forms: validate with Zod schemas from `$lib/schemas/`; display field-coupled errors inline.
- Design system: follow color tokens in `src/app.css` and the design system rules (§ 3.0 in project guidelines).
- Before drafting new components or major UI changes, run `mcp_svelte_list-sections` and fetch relevant guidance with `mcp_svelte_get-documentation` to align with Svelte best practices.
- Before returning any new or updated `.svelte` code, run `mcp_svelte_svelte-autofixer` and incorporate required fixes.
- Formatting: expand long attribute lists vertically; keep `<style>` selectors and declarations on separate lines; prefer descriptive names.
- Mode transitions: use `transition-all duration-500` for seamless mode switching between Parse and Flashcard modes.
- Modals: follow the split-view modal pattern from `12-modal-patterns.mdc`; ensure escape key and click-outside dismissal.
- Color conventions:
  - Background: `#222831` (main), `#31363f` (sections/buttons)
  - Text: `#76abae` (primary), `#eeeeee` (secondary)
  - Icons: `#76abae` (nav bar), `#eeeeee` (toolbar)
  - Hover: `#415780` (buttons)
